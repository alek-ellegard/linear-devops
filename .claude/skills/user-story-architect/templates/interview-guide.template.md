| "It breaks sometimes" | How often? What triggers it? What's the impact? |
| "We need better X" | What does "better" mean? How do you measure it? |
| "It should be automatic" | What triggers it? What decisions are needed? What if it fails? |
| "Everyone uses it" | Who exactly? How many? Different use patterns? |
